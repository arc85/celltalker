# celltalker

The goal of celltalker is to infer putative ligand and receptor
interactions from single-cell RNAseq data. This is accomplished by
evaluating known cognate ligand/receptor interactions across groups of
cells. Interactions are scored by jointly weighting the expression
levels of ligands and receptors, and significance is evaluated by
comparing to a background distribution of scrambled ligands and
receptors.
